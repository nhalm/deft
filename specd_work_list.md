# Work List

<!--
Single execution queue for all work — spec implementations, audit findings, and promoted review items.

HOW IT WORKS:

1. Pick an unblocked item (no `(blocked: ...)` annotation)
2. Implement it
3. Validate cross-file dependencies
4. Move the completed item from this file to specd_history.md
5. Check this file for items whose `(blocked: ...)` annotation references the
   work you just completed — remove the annotation to unblock them
6. Delete the spec header in this file if no more items are under it
7. LOOP_COMPLETE when this file has no unblocked items remaining

POPULATED BY: /specd:plan command (during spec phase), /specd:audit command, /specd:review-intake command, and humans.

## logging v0.3

- Ensure Foreman/Lead callers of git functions log appropriately when git operations fail: review call sites in `lib/deft/job/foreman.ex` and `lib/deft/job/lead.ex` that call `GitJob.*` functions and add warning/error logs where the caller doesn't already handle failures visibly.
- Ensure Agent caller logs provider failures: review `lib/deft/agent.ex` handling of provider error events and connection failures — confirm error-level logs exist at the agent level (not provider level) per spec §4.

## web-ui v0.4

- Implement force-abort for double Ctrl+c in chat_live.ex: both single and double Ctrl+c call `Deft.Agent.abort(agent)`. Spec §6.4 requires double Ctrl+c to force-abort. Need `Deft.Agent.force_abort/1` (or equivalent) that kills the agent process immediately rather than requesting graceful abort. (blocked: harness — Agent module needs force_abort/1)
