# Work List

<!--
Single execution queue for all work — spec implementations, audit findings, and promoted review items.

HOW IT WORKS:

1. Pick an unblocked item (no `(blocked: ...)` annotation)
2. Implement it
3. Validate cross-file dependencies
4. Move the completed item from this file to specd_history.md
5. Check this file for items whose `(blocked: ...)` annotation references the
   work you just completed — remove the annotation to unblock them
6. Delete the spec header in this file if no more items are under it
7. LOOP_COMPLETE when this file has no unblocked items remaining

POPULATED BY: /specd:plan command (during spec phase), /specd:audit command, /specd:review-intake command, and humans.

## web-ui v0.9

- Add "New" button to header in `chat_live.ex` template, before the Sessions button, using `.header-button` class. On click, handle a `"new_session"` event that calls `Deft.Session.create/1`, then navigates the current window to `/?session=<new_id>` via `push_navigate`
